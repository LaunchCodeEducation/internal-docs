<img src="../images/animated.gif" rel:animated_src="../images/animated.gif" />

An animated GIF with controlled animation can be inserted with the syntax:

```html
<img src="../images/animated.gif" rel:animated_src="../images/animated.gif" />
```

The [libgif](https://github.com/chrisbay/libgif-js) script will enable animation on `mouseover`, and stop on `mouseout`. Currently, all GIFs within a page are parsed.
